<h1>Rhythm </h1>
Do you like being organized? Do you want to be better at managing your time? Do you love listening to music? Have you ever tried just to change the playlist but ended up surfing the internet instead of doing your work?  
<br><br>
Try Rhythm! Rhythm will give you an awesome experience to be productive and enjoy music at the same time. Simply choose your list of music while creating each task. Rhythm will play and change your playlist FOR YOU when you start a new activity, and all you need to do is focusing on your schedule!
